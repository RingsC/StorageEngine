                         Redland librdf RDF API Library

[2]Dave Beckett

Overview

   [3]Redland librdf is a library that provides a high-level interface for
   the Resource Description Framework (RDF) allowing the RDF graph to be
   parsed from XML, stored, queried and manipulated. Redland librdf
   implements each of the RDF concepts in its own class via an object
   based API, reflected into the language APIs, currently C#, Java, Perl,
   PHP, Python, Ruby and Tcl. Several classes providing functionality such
   as for parsers, storage are built as modules that can be loaded at
   compile or run-time as required.

   This is a mature and stable RDF library developed since 2000 used in
   multiple projects. See the [4]FAQS for general information and the
   [5]Redland issue tracker for known bugs and issues. A summary of the
   changes can be found in the [6]NEWS file, detailed API changes in the
   [7]release notes and file-by-file changes in the Subversion
   [8]ChangeLog.

   Redland librdf provides:
     * A modular, [9]object based library written in C
     * APIs for manipulating the RDF [10]graph and parts - [11]Statements,
       [12]Resources and Literals
     * Language Bindings in Perl, PHP, Python and Ruby via the [13]Redland
       Bindings package.
     * Reading and writing multiple RDF syntaxes with [14]Parsers and
       [15]Serializers via the [16]Raptor RDF Parser Toolkit.
     * [17]Storage for graphs in memory and persistently with
       Sleepycat/Berkeley DB, MySQL 3-5, PostgreSQL, SQLite, Openlink
       Virtuoso, in-memory Trees, files or URIs.
     * [18]Query language support for SPARQL 1.0 (some 1.1) and RDQL using
       [19]Rasqal.
     * APIs for accessing the graph by Statement (triples) or by Nodes and
       Arcs
     * Contexts for managing aggregating named graphs and recording
       provenance.
     * [20]Statement Streams for efficient construction, parsing and
       serialisation of graphs
     * [21]rdfproc RDF processor utility program
     * No memory leaks.
