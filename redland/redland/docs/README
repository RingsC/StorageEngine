API DOCUMENTATION

   The API DocBook documentation is generated automatically from the
   source code using the Linux kernel kernel-doc program which you can get
   as the file scripts/kernel-doc in the distribution. Each of the higher
   level language APIs contains a mapping to the core C API and may also
   include extra documentation describing the native APIs along with
   examples of use.
