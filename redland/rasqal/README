                            Rasqal RDF Query Library

Dave Beckett

Overview

   Rasqal is a free software / Open Source C library that handles Resource
   Description Framework (RDF) query language syntaxes, query construction
   and execution of queries returning results as bindings, boolean, RDF
   graphs/triples or syntaxes. The supported query languages are SPARQL
   Query 1.0, SPARQL Query 1.1, SPARQL Update 1.1 (no executing) and the
   Experimental SPARQL extensions (LAQRS). Rasqal can write binding query
   results in the SPARQL XML, SPARQL JSON, CSV, TSV, HTML, ASCII tables,
   RDF/XML and Turtle / N3 and read them in SPARQL XML, RDF/XML and Turtle
   / N3.

   Rasqal was designed to work closely with the Redland RDF library and
   the Raptor[2] RDF Syntax Library but is entirely separate from both.

   This is a beta quality library - the code is mature, the API is mostly
   stable but changing slowly. Rasqal supports all of SPARQL 1.0 query and
   most of SPARQL 1.1 query. It is a portable library and has been tested
   on multiple POSIX systems and architectures. Rasqal has no known memory
   leaks.

   A summary of the changes can be found in the NEWS file and detailed API
   changes in the release notes.

   Rasqal provides:
     * An RDF query construction and access API.
     * Query language support for SPARQL 1.0 Query.
     * Query language support for most of draft SPARQL 1.1 Query.
     * A query execution engine executing sub-queries, aggregate
       expressions and grouping.
     * The complete SPARQL 1.1 (draft) built-in function and operator
       library
     * A query result binding API.
     * Query result bindings formatting into SPARQL XML, SPARQL JSON, CSV,
       TSV, HTML, ASCII tables, RDF/XML, Turtle / N3 and from SPARQL XML,
       RDF/XML and Turtle / N3.
     * Triple store querying APIs to support running over external RDF
       graphs.
     * No memory leaks.
     * roqet standalone command line RDF query utility program

   Known bugs and issues are recorded in the Redland issue tracker.

   Rasqal does not provide an RDF API or triple store, but relies on
   external libraries implementing the triple store API providing matched
   RDF data originally from a specified content URI. Rasqal ships with a
   triple store implementation using the output of an RDF parser from
   Raptor. This can be called using the standalone command line roqet
   query utility giving a query language identifier (default sparql), the
   query string and optionally the data to use unless it is declared in
   the query string.

   Rasqal is used inside Redland to provide support for query languages, a
   query API and a result bindings API over graphs stored in indexed
   Redland triple stores. Since this can index the triples it will be
   faster than the default rasqal triple store of reading the triples from
   Raptor into memory when the queries are complex.

Supported Query Languages

  SPARQL Query Language for RDF

   Rasqal provides complete support for the W3C SPARQL Query Language 1.0
   developed by the W3C RDF Data Access Working Group, as defined in
   SPARQL Query Language for RDF, W3C Recommendation 15 January 2008.

   Rasqal implements most of the SPARQL 1.1 Query and SPARQL 1.1 Update
   W3C Working Drafts of 05 January 2012 including aggregates, subqueries,
   expression in SELECT, assignment, short form for CONSTRUCT and all the
   new set of builtin functions and operators.

   Unimplemented parts of SPARQL 1.1:
     * BIND scope
     * VALUES (formerly called BINDINGS): part of federated query
     * Decimal and double canonical format details
     * EXISTS / NOT EXISTS
     * JSON result format reading
     * MINUS
     * Property Paths: These are likely never be supported since it is a
       lot of work (estimate: 3 months full time) and might need multiple
       new APIs to talk to the storage layer.
     * SERVICE: Part of federated query

   Out of scope parts of SPARQL 1.1:
     * Entailment and inference: Rasqal is not an inference engine
     * SPARQL Federated Query
     * SPARQL Update (also called SPARQL Protocol): The Update syntax is
       parsed with parser name 'sparql-update' but nothing is executed
       inside Rasqal. Supporting SPARQL Update requires a protocol server
       that responds to requests to perform operations on a graph store.
       Rasqal is a query library and does not have an event loop or triple
       store. Redstore is a system supporting SPARQL Update and Service
       Description built with Rasqal by using Redland librdf for graph
       storage and query.

   The details on the Rasqal support for SPARQL 1.1 can be found at the
   rasqal testing SPARQL 1.1 page which shows the SPARQL 1.1 tests that
   fail and any diagnosis.

  LAQRS Adds to Querying RDF in SPARQL (LAQRS)

   LAQRS is an experimental set of syntax extensions for SPARQL. The
   syntax and features may change at any time. At present Rasqal provides
   parsing and API support for alternate update syntaxes, the EXPLAIN
   keyword, plus executing a few experimental extension functions: NOW() /
   CURRENT_DATETIME(), FROM_UNIXTIME() and TO_UNIXTIME().

Installation and Documentation

   The public API is described in the API reference. It is demonstrated in
   the roqet utility program which shows how to call the query engine and
   operate over the query results. When Rasqal is used inside Redland, the
   Redland documentation explains how to call the query engine and
   contains several example programs.

   To build and install Rasqal from sources see the Installation document.

Sources

   The packaged sources are available from
   http://download.librdf.org/source/ (master site) and also from the
   SourceForge site. The development GIT sources can also be browsed on
   GitHub or checked out at git://github.com/dajobe/rasqal.git

   Rasqal requires Raptor 2.0.7 or newer to build and run, which can be
   downloaded from the same area as the Rasqal source and binaries.
