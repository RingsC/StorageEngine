.B redland-config
[\-\-cflags]

.SH DESCRIPTION
\fIredland-config\fP is a tool that is used to determine the compile and
linker flags that should be used to compile and link programs that use
the Redland RDF library.
.SH OPTIONS
\fIredland-config\fP accepts the following options:
.TP 8
.B  \-\-version
Print the currently installed version of redland on the standard output.
.TP 8
.B  \-\-version\-decimal
Print the currently installed version of redland as a decimal integer.
.TP 8
.B  \-\-libs
Print the linker flags that are necessary to link a redland program.
This excludes linker arguments used to build the librdf shared library.
.TP 8
.B  \-\-libtool\-libs
Print the flags that are necessary to link a redland program with libtool.
.TP 8
.B  \-\-private\-libs
Print the linker flags that are necessary to build the librdf shared
library.  This option is not usually needed because the librdf
shared library has already been dynamically linked against these libs.
.TP 8
.B  \-\-cflags
Print the compiler flags that are necessary to compile a redland program.
.TP 8
.B  \-\-prefix=PREFIX
If specified, use PREFIX instead of the installation prefix that
redland was built with when computing the output for the
\-\-cflags and \-\-libs options. This option must be specified before
any \-\-libs or \-\-cflags options.
