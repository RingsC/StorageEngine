 *	  Routines for inter-process latches
 *
 * A latch is a boolean variable, with operations that let you to sleep
 * until it is set. A latch can be set from another process, or a signal
 * handler within the same process.
 *
 * The latch interface is a reliable replacement for the common pattern of
 * using pg_usleep() or select() to wait until a signal arrives, where the
 * signal handler sets a global variable. Because on some platforms, an
 * incoming signal doesn't interrupt sleep, and even on platforms where it
 * does there is a race condition if the signal arrives just before
 * entering the sleep, the common pattern must periodically wake up and
 * poll the global variable. pselect() system call was invented to solve
 * the problem, but it is not portable enough. Latches are designed to
 * overcome these limitations, allowing you to sleep without polling and
 * ensuring a quick response to signals from other processes.
 *
 * There are two kinds of latches: local and shared. A local latch is
 * initialized by InitLatch, and can only be set from the same process.
 * A local latch can be used to wait for a signal to arrive, by calling
 * SetLatch in the signal handler. A shared latch resides in shared memory,
 * and must be initialized at postmaster startup by InitSharedLatch. Before
 * a shared latch can be waited on, it must be associated with a process
 * with OwnLatch. Only the process owning the latch can wait on it, but any
 * process can set it.
 *
 * There are three basic operations on a latch:
 *
 * SetLatch		- Sets the latch
 * ResetLatch	- Clears the latch, allowing it to be set again
 * WaitLatch	- Waits for the latch to become set
 *
 * The correct pattern to wait for an event is:
 *
 * for (;;)
 * {
 *	   ResetLatch();
 *	   if (work to do)
 *		   Do Stuff();
 *
 *	   WaitLatch();
 * }
 *
 * It's important to reset the latch *before* checking if there's work to
 * do. Otherwise, if someone sets the latch between the check and the
 * ResetLatch call, you will miss it and Wait will block.
 *
 * To wake up the waiter, you must first set a global flag or something
 * else that the main loop tests in the "if (work to do)" part, and call
 * SetLatch *after* that. SetLatch is designed to return quickly if the
 * latch is already set.
 *
 *
 * Implementation
 * --------------
 *
 * The Unix implementation uses the so-called self-pipe trick to overcome
 * the race condition involved with select() and setting a global flag
 * in the signal handler. When a latch is set and the current process
 * is waiting for it, the signal handler wakes up the select() in
 * WaitLatch by writing a byte to a pipe. A signal by itself doesn't
 * interrupt select() on all platforms, and even on platforms where it
 * does, a signal that arrives just before the select() call does not
 * prevent the select() from entering sleep. An incoming byte on a pipe
 * however reliably interrupts the sleep, and makes select() to return
 * immediately if the signal arrives just before select() begins.
 *
 * When SetLatch is called from the same process that owns the latch,
 * SetLatch writes the byte directly to the pipe. If it's owned by another
 * process, SIGUSR1 is sent and the signal handler in the waiting process
 * writes the byte to the pipe on behalf of the signaling process.
